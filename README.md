# COMP7404 project group14
## Introduce
This is the final version of our original paper reproduction with the addition of other methods for comparison. 
We are acutely aware of the problems in our project. On the basis of the original paper, we decided to make some optimization of its method in order to obtain better results.
## The method we use
### The main methods used in this paper are K-means and SVM.
The main code files involved are as follows:
- main.py (L1-L169) from LIJIAHUI
- onlySVM.py (L1-L78) from DENGBOYUAN
- hyperparameter_optimization_SVM.py (L1-L87) from DENGBOYUAN
- projectSVM.py (L1-L155) from XIAYIFAN
- kmeans.py (L1-L61,L152-L267) from XIAYIFAN,(L62-L151) from DENGBOYUAN
- model_evaluation (L1-L21) from LIJIAHUI
- data_processing.py (L1-L87) from LIJIAHUI

*There are two versions of the SVM code because the effect of first version isn't very well.

### New methods code files are as follows:
- KNN.py (L1-L72) from HUANGANQI
- logistic_regression.py (L1-L71) from HUANGANQI
- naive_bayes.py (L1-L87) from HUANGANQI
- random_forest.py (L1-L91) from HUANGANQI
- onlyMLP.py (L1-L77) from DENGBOYUAN, (L78-L127) from LIJIAHUI
- hyperparameter_optimization_MLP.py (L1-L33) from LIJIAHUI
